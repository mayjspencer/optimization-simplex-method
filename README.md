# Simplex Method - Full Tableau Implemenation
Course project for my Computational Methods in Discrete Optimization class (CS 4433). 

Course project for Computational Methods in Discrete Optimization. Python code that creates a command line tool for the full tableau implementation of the Simplex Method.

## **Objectives**

- Implement the full tableau simplex to solve Example 3.5 in our textbook.
- Can not use any specialized optimization packages (such as scipy.optimize in python) to solve the problem.
- Rather, need to manually implement the full algorithm and generate the full tableau for each iteration of the algorithm, where each tableau is in the exact format shown in Example 3.5 (including the zeroth row and column).
- The final submission should include the full source code and the output
